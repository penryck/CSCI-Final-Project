# Name: Chunin Exam (Final Project)
# Purpose: A Text based arena combat game based on the naruto tv series.
# we opted to use the command line interface rather than implement a gui
# this allowed us to spend more time on a more complicated battle system
# that and the command line interface has a certain minimalist appeal.
